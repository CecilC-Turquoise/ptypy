TODO
====

* Implement regular dumps. This could be done with Pytcho.dump(), which is run
every iteration. This method checks if it is time to dump and if so it uses
self.save_run with alt_file=self.paths.dump_file. Dumps should probably always
save the complete flat structure. In parameters, we simply add
p.paths.dump_interval. There should be an option for dumping always with the
same filename (a kind of autosave).

* Implement to_dict and from_dict for all classes, and figure how they can be
stored in a file - keeping in mind that many of these objects will hold
references to other objects. Use h5 references for this? Or numerical IDs?

* Improve the plotting (including option not to use interaction.

* Implement Poisson and Euclidean ML models.
