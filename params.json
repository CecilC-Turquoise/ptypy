{"name":"Ptypy","tagline":"Ptychography reconstruction package","body":"PTYPY - Ptychography Reconstruction for Python\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\nPtypy (pronounced typy, forget the p, as in ptychography or psychology) is a\r\nreconstruction package for ptychographic datasets.\r\n\r\nTo get started quickly, look at the examples in the template directory. You will\r\nalso need to prepare your data in a hdf5 file and following a structure that\r\nptypy can understand. Ptypy provides already routines to prepare data from three\r\nbeamlines (cSAXS, PSI; I13, Diamond; and I22, ESRF) and more will come.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\nPtypy was designed with flexibility in mind: it should allow rapid development\r\nof new ideas. To this end, much of the \"ugly\" details have been hidden in\r\nadvanced containers that manage data and access \"views\" onto them. \r\n\r\nCurrently implemented:\r\n- Fully parallelized (using MPI)\r\n- Difference map algorithm with power bound constraint\r\n- Maximum Likelihood with preconditioners and regularizers.\r\n- Mixed-state reconstructions of probe and object\r\n- Multiple-wavelength reconstruction\r\n- On-the-fly reconstructions (while data is being acquired) \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nInstallation should be as simple as\r\n    sudo python setup.py install\r\nor, as a user,\r\n    python setup.py install --user\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\nPtypy depends on standard python packages:\r\n * numpy\r\n * scipy\r\n * matplotlib\r\n * h5py\r\n * mpi4py (optional - required for parallel computing)\r\n * zeromq (optional - required for the offline plotting client)\r\n * maybe some more we forgot to put in this list.\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Issue Tracker: github.com/ptycho/ptypy/issues\r\n- Source Code: github.com/ptycho/ptypy\r\n\r\nSupport\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIf you are having issues, please let us know.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe project is licensed under a GPLv2 license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
